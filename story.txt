There once was a man from Berlin,
Who went to the Flughafen.
He had some Bratwurst,
and drove a BMW.
But later traded it for a Porsche.

There's another who hailed from Munich,
Who really loved RammsteinMusik,
He devoured some brot,
Then felt very hot,
The gluten was making him sick.
So he drove home in his Audi,

Disappointed of course
to have been beaten by Gauss
